<br>
<P>
The May program will be a guided tour of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
Meet outside Norrie’s Gift Shop at the Arboretum.  Our tour guides will be club member Steve McCabe, noted succulent expert who recently retired from the Arboretum, and docent Mike Clark.  This arboretum specializes in Mediterranean-climate plants (California, S Africa, Australia, New Zealand) and also specializes in plants that are attractive to hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
General admission and guided-tour fees will be covered by the club for those members who register in advance by Thursday May 11th with club President Sonia Dyer at <a href='mailto:sonia.dyer@sbcglobal.net?Subject=May%20Program%20Registration'>sonia.dyer@sbcglobal.net</a> or 408-629-5735, or cell 408-858-4027.  Since relatively few participants chose to ride the scheduled tour bus for our last field trip, this one will be drive-yourself.  If you wish to carpool, please make your own arrangements.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Keep in mind that weekend drives over the mountain can be slow due to crowds of beach-goers, so get an early start.  You may wish to have breakfast in Santa Cruz, or spend some time before the tour visiting one of the plant nurseries in the neighborhood for a Mother’s Day gift.  Kathi Cambiano recommends Dig Gardens <a href='https://diggardens.com/' target='_blank'>https://diggardens.com/</a> 420 Water St, Santa Cruz.

fmart ("Spotlight Interview with Katya Romanova","Asmita Deshpande","","When Katya was six years old, she saw a plant in her parent’s friend’s home (which she now knows was <I>Graptopetalum</I>) and was very impressed by its colors.  From that point on, she fell in love with succulents, and, as she grew older, she started collecting them.  At first, it was by collecting cuttings from friends. Back in Russia, this was easily done.  When she moved to the US, growing the collection was much easier because of the availability of the plants.</P><P>Her favorites are Lithops, and she has collected about fifty varieties of them.  She likes them, because they are very unique, produce wonderful flowers and require very little space.</P><P>Katya is a software engineer and works at Sony PlayStation.  Her sixteen-year-old son is also a member of our society. Besides growing succulents, she likes to hike, travel, ski, play tennis, and grow vegetables and orchids.  She has a small collection of orchids.</P><P>Her message to the society is to have more activities like making pottery for our plants, visiting other people’s gardens, learning to make succulent arrangements like wreaths, orbs or in containers, hiking where we can find some succulents like <I>Dudleya</I>, and painting succulents.  If any of the members know any particular craft or technique, they can teach us.");

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","","<center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('1plantneedsuppotted.jpg',998,665)><img src='1plantneedsuppotted.jpg' width=399 height=266 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>I have been asked time and again over the years why they can buy a plant and when they go to repot it there is soil with no roots in it but there is a small square or round ball of soil with roots in it.  This root ball is usually quite small, mostly 5 cm square and about the same deep.  The seller of the plants had gone to wholesale nurseries and bought his selling stock.  The nursery will grow plants from seed or they buy small plants that nicely go in the 5 cm pots.  We call the pots 2 inch pots for that is what they are sold as. They are 2 inch by 2 inch square and 2 1/8 inches deep.  Some people call the pots 'thumb pots'.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>I have seen many times where a seller goes to the wholesaler and buys trays of plants in 2 inch pots.  Not wanting to sell plants in the small pots, they will up pot the plants into 3.5 or 4 inch pots.  The easiest way to up pot them is just to pop the plants out of the small pot and stick them in the larger pot and pack some soil around that root ball.  Many years ago I worked at a cactus and succulent nursery, and I was told several times by the owner that the girl they had there before me was much faster in potting plants than what I was.  I knew why, as I found a lot of plants that had been in the 2 inch pots and all she did was pop the plants out of the pot and jam it in the larger pot.  Around that root ball the new soil was packed and the plant top dressed and put out on the sale tables.  I know that some of these plants had been up potted about five years before I found them.  After I found plants that were not growing very well if any at all and I repotted them, they would commence growing.</P><P>I have seen at shows where people will take a plant they want for a show plant and they will pot it into a show pot. The show pots are usually ceramic pots.  The person will find a pot they like and in goes the plant as it came out of the pot it was in. They get it all pretty looking and it looks good in its new pot.  On the way to the show the soil either settles some or there is some bouncing on the roads for the root ball shows up as it was.  At a recent show, there were several plants that had not been taken care of correctly when potted in the show pot.  The root ball was showing about as much as 1 cm or 3/8 of an inch above the new soil and topdressing.  It was easy to see that the person just popped the plant out of the pot it was in and stuffed it into the new pot and added soil so the plant was settled and looking good.  I am guessing as to what happened; on the trip to the show venue the vibration and the bouncing of the pot settled the new soil leaving the top of the root ball showing.</td></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('2uppot.jpg',998,665)><img src='2uppot.jpg' width=399 height=266 hspace=17 vspace=17 class='enl' align='left'></a><a href=javascript:poppic('345uppot.jpg',500,976)><img src='345uppot.jpg' width=250 height=488 hspace=17 vspace=17 class='enl' align='right'></a><br>The photo at the start of this article is a plant that I say needs to be up potted. It could live for a while longer in the present pot; but for its growing and being healthy I want to give it a new pot.  I dumped the topdressing off from around the plant and popped the plant out of the pot.  The photo to the left is the root ball right out of the pot.  In the photo top right, I have taken my tool and beveled the top of the root ball at about a 45 degree angle.  What that does is to remove the top layer of old soil and also bevels the edge of the root ball so if it is potted as it is it will not show above the new soil. Most plants will not grow roots into the new soil unless the soil is the same as what it has been growing in.  The photo middle right shows the side of the root ball after I have scuffed up the root area. The photo bottom right shows the bottom of the root ball where I have also loosened the soil and have moved some roots out of the soil ball.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><center><a href=javascript:poppic('7pottingtool.jpg',987,156)><img src='7pottingtool.jpg' width=494 height=78 hspace=17 vspace=17 class='enl'></a></center><br>The photo above is the tool I use most of the time when working at repotting or up potting my plants. That is an old three sided file. It was used for sharpening saw blades or for filing narrow V notches in metal.  I have used the file for many years as can be seen by the rounded end.  I use that end to bevel the soil or for a scraper to scuff the root ball.  The pointed end I use for scuffing the root ball sides and bottom along with removing the top dressing around the plant.  It has had a lot of use as can be seen by its rounded end, and it is quite a bit shorter than when I started using it 30 years ago.  I like using this tool for it is not sharp and so it does not cut the roots.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('9uppottedplant.jpg',987,768)><img src='9uppottedplant.jpg' width=496 height=384 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the right is the plant in a larger pot. I pot the plants about 1 to 1.5 cm higher than what I think looks good.  The reason for that is that the new soil will settle and so will the plant. I tap the side of the pot while holding on to the plant to help settle the soil in the roots and also into the pot.  Do not pack it hard!!  If I did not hold onto the plant, it would settle with the soil and be potted too deep.  Once I have the soil settled, I top it off with the top dressing.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");
