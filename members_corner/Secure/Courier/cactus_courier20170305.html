<br>
<P>
The UC Davis Botanical Conservatory and Ernesto Sandoval have been experimenting with a greater diversity of aloes here in Northern California. Ernesto would like to share his experience with growing and propagating Aloes beyond some of the common species such as <I>A. comosa</I>, <I>melanacantha</I>, <I>peglerae</I>, <I>hereroensis</I> and other cool/wet tolerant species. 
</P>
<P>
He will touch on the more and less available Aloes.  Although his talk is focused for Northern California conditions, his program will include those that are less suitable for our climate and more suitable for Southern California or parts of the Bay Area.  As always, he will bring a selection of uncommon succulents, Aloes, and other plants for your collections and gardens and to help the Botanical Conservatory’s programs.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Sandoval has been wondering and seeking questions to why plants grow and look the way that they do for a long time.  Now he explains and interprets the world of plants to a variety of ages and experiences from K-12 to professionals and Master Gardeners.  He regularly lectures to a variety of western Garden Clubs throughout the year and particularly to Succulent Clubs throughout the State and elsewhere since that group of plants is his particular passion within his general passion for plants.  He describes himself as a &quot;Jose of All Plants, Master of None.&quot;  Ernesto thoroughly enjoys helping others, and gardeners in particular, to understand why and how plants do what they do.

fmart ("The Prez Sez","Sonia Dyer","","Start saving up cardboard boxes for our customers to use at our Spring Show and Sale, which is scheduled for April 29th and 30th at the usual place, namely Peterson Middle School in Sunnyvale.  Also start thinking about the kinds of jobs you personally can do during the set-up the day beforehand, as well as during the show, to make it a success for the club.  Our Shows and Sales are where the club gets most of its funds to pay our operating expenses for the rest of the year.</P><P>Since at our Spring Shows we always have expert jurors come in to award prizes to the best Show plants, extra work is involved from us club members in setting up the submitted plants in the right categories, as well as clerk-assistants to help the judges as they go about choosing the best of the best.  So we will be needing lots of volunteers to work with Jaan Lepson in the Show area, especially on Friday evening April 28th.  Remember that if you volunteer 2 or more hours of your time, you get $10 in free ShowBucks to apply toward your purchases.  And on Friday evening you get pizza!  And on Saturday and Sunday you get lunch!</P><P>As our Show and Sale falls so late in April, we will still be having a regular club meeting early in April.  April’s topic will be a roundtable discussion led by club VP Loyd Monaco on preparing your plants for the Show and Sale.  For example, suppose you would like to sell some small number of plants on the club table at the show – how do you need to prepare your plants, and what else do you need to do before you can sell?   Or suppose you have a couple of fine specimen plants you would like to see win a prize in the Show – what do the judges look for?</P><P>Also, as several members have expressed interest in having a short hands-on practice session on how to access and use the club’s new social media internet sites, we will do that before getting into the roundtable discussion.  So bring your smartphones or tablets to the April meeting so you can practice.  There is no wi-fi in the building, so only smartphones and tablets that have access to cellular data will be usable during this practice session.  If you already know this stuff, come prepared to assist the newbies.</P><P>If you haven’t already done so, prepare ahead of time by creating your own Facebook and Instagram accounts.  To do this, use your browser to go to facebook.com, and instagram.com, and set up a User Name and Password for yourself to use.  Write these down.  Then, if you have an Apple device, go to the Apple Store, and if you have a Samsung/Android device, go to the Google Play Store using your device’s web browser.  Search for &quot;Facebook&quot; and &quot;Instagram&quot;, and follow the directions to download the apps to your device.  They’re both free.   Then use your User Name and Password to log into these apps.  You should only have to log in the first time you use them – the device should remember them for you after that.</P><P>Reminder to the Board of Directors, the March Board Meeting will begin at 11AM sharp, and everyone needs to be on time and focused, so we can finish by noon.  If you need to bring other items into the building, then you need to arrive a few minutes early to take care of that so we start up on schedule.   Review the minutes of the last board meeting ahead of time to remind yourself of your action items.");

fmart ("February 2002 Revisited:What's Bugging You?","Jim Daniel","","What bugs me is the soil mixes we all use to plant our Cactus and Succulents in.  Everybody has a different recipe they follow.  I have seen cactus growing on mountaintops on Limestone rocks like <I>Agave victoria-reginae</I>.  I have seen them growing in dry lakebeds that were sometimes under water like <I>Ariocarpus kotschobeyanus</I> and <I>Porfiria schwartzii</I> (<I>Mammilaria cohulensis</I>).  The majority of Cactus grow on the slopes of mountains or on small hills.</P><P>I stopped at a small nursery outside of White City, NM.  It was located at a trailer house out in the desert.  The plants were in tin cans and all native to the region.  They were potted in desert soil in full sun, no shade, on barbecue tables.  One table had a hand written sign, plants one dollar each.  One had a sign, two dollars each, and so on.  His sales method was the honor system.  At least he had all the plants in the same soil mix.</P><P>You can't formulate a mix that fits all plants, so we formulate a mix that fits most plants.  The big advantage in having a standard mix is they all dry out at the same time (depending on pot size).");

The photo to the right is of <I>Mammillaria solisioides,</I> and the one below is of <I>Mammillaria pectinifera</I>. Note how in the photo below, the spine clusters looks like a swarm of bugs marching out of a hole; then compare that with the photo to the right, which only looks like a tangle of spines in the growing point.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('10mammillariapectinfera.jpg',1069,900)><img src='10mammillariapectinfera.jpg' width=460 height=387 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo the left shows the typical flowers of the plant we know as <I>Mammillaria pectinifera</I>.  The flowers are 3 cm in diameter the petals are light pink with a darker midstripe.  Flower center is shell pink.  Compare with the yellow flowers on the plant in the photo above. Very different!</P><P>The two plants have been mixed up for some 64 years.

Spine numbers, spine shape, flower color and flower size.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>In reality the plants we know as <I>Mammillaria solisioides</I> should be named <I>Mammillaria pectinata</I> as it was described as <I>Solisia pectinata</I>.  The plant we know as <I>Mammillaria pectinifera</I> should be nameless or given a correct description, as I have given above, as it has not been described correctly.  For any description tied to it is not correct and belongs to <I>Solisia pectinata</I> [<I>M. solisioides</I>].</td></tr></TABLE></center>");
