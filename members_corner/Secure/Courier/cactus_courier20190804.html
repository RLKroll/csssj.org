fmart ("Growers Garden","Elton Roberts","","<center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'><I>Mammillaria nazasensis</I> SB 489 is a wonderful <I>Mammillaria</I>, even with its light pink flowers.  It will, in time, make a nice clump of about tennis ball size stems.  It does have those nice hooked spines that seem to say &quot;Stay and visit a while.&quot;  If you do not want to ruin the looks of the plant, you will carefully remove yourself from the hooks.  Many times when reaching for another plant, those hooks will reach out and snag your shirt sleeve, and then it is 'talk to yourself' or even 'call the plant names' time.  I try to keep any hooked-spined plants away from the edge of the table.  But I still get hooked up at times.  I have seen people in sweaters bend over a hooked-spined plant to reach a plant they think they want, and, when they straighten up, they will have a plant hanging from the sweater.  I remember one woman having three hooked-spined plants hanging from her sweater. <br> <br>The plants do not like alkaline water, and it took me a while to discover why they would not live for me.  I lost most of my plants to alkaline water.  That is really disgusting and also discouraging.  At the time, I did not know why they would only sit and slowly get smaller and smaller, until the spines were so close together you could not tell if the plant was still alive.  When they were hard as a rock, I knew it was time to give up on them and toss them.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('1mammillarianazasensis.jpg',1011,669)><img src='1mammillarianazasensis.jpg' width=354 height=234 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><a href=javascript:poppic('2mammillarianazasensis.jpg',1011,669)><img src='2mammillarianazasensis.jpg' width=354 height=234 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left tells the entire story of the plant, stem, buds, flowers, spines and offsets.  The plant is about 8 cm tall and the main stem is 7 cm in diameter.  As can be seen, the plants are happy with acidic water, as they are growing, throwing buds, opening flowers and also growing offsets, all at the same time.  The photo to the right is of a nice clump that is 17.5 cm in diameter.  The three large stems are 6 cm x 6 cm.  It is time for the plant to go up into another pot that is about 5 cm larger in diameter.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('3mammillarianazasensis.jpg',1011,669)><img src='3mammillarianazasensis.jpg' width=354 height=234 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left is of the offsets and shows the growing point and a ring of buds.  Whenever the plant bloomed for me, it always had a ring of flowers.  In the photos, all show the spines with the centrals sticking out quite a way above the radials and even above the flowers, when they are open.  To my eyes, the spines are pinkish with a touch of yellow; I fail to see any orange to them.  Maybe some will say they are tannish pink.  I also do not see that the spines are strongly pubescent; in fact, I see only a little pubescence to the spines.  Maybe that is just on my plants, but all the plants I have seen and had are all about the same with the same color of spines and with little or no pubescence.  I know that the look-a-like plant <I>Mammillaria pennispinosa</I> has pubescent spines, and the radials and centrals are pubescent.  In the photo to the right, I have to take the spines up to the size of a pencil to even see any pubescence on the new spines.  The photo also shows the growing point of the stem, and it is hard to figure where it is, as it is not depressed or concave.  So, it is not easy to tell where it is except for the smaller spines.  The photo also gives a good view of the two dozen flowers that are open.  Look inside the ring of flowers, and you can see several rings of buds waiting their turn to open.  I see at least three more rings of buds waiting their turn. <a href=javascript:poppic('4mammillarianazasensis.jpg',1011,669)><img src='4mammillarianazasensis.jpg' width=354 height=234 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('5mammillarianazasensis.jpg',1011,669)><img src='5mammillarianazasensis.jpg' width=354 height=234 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left shows the central spines sticking up above the open flowers and looking like meerkats on sentry duty.  Here the flowers are close up, and the midstripe up the petals can be seen.  There is little difference in the outer midstripe and the inner midstripe.  The filaments and style are a light pink.  The stigma is super light pink to white.  With the flowers this close together, they do not open out wide but are still to over 1.5 cm in diameter.  They look white with a pinkish midstripe but, in fact, are light pink with a darker midstripe.  The pollen is a creamy yellow. </P><P>I keep the plants dry over the winter and am not in too much of a hurry in the spring time to water early, for the plant can decide to rebel and die.  Give good light but be careful not to sunburn the plant.  Yes even with the thick spines, it can get sunburned.  For good spine growth and good flowering, give it good, very bright light.

While that sounds like a daunting mouthful, the experience itself was equal parts enjoyable, rewarding, and inspiring.</P><P>The first day was devoted to field trips: my group had signed up for a visit to the spectacular beachside cliffs of Montaña del Oro.  We did get there, but not before we were &quot;hijacked&quot; by two professors from the California Polytechnic State University, who took us to the Elfin Forest first.</P><P>I'm glad they did. The Elfin Forest is amazing, and quite possibly unique.  It hosts a variety of interesting succulents, and combines several environmental factors -- being on a hilltop, having loose sand for soil, and receiving periodic salty sprays from the ocean -- to foster hardy, hunkered-down residents.  Indeed, its name comes from the low profile maintained by its occupants.  It hosts, among many other things, an oak tree with normal genes, one which would reach for the sky under ordinary circumstances but which has sprawled itself horizontally across the landscape instead.  I highly recommend visiting the site, if you're ever in the area.</P><P>After the Elfin Forest, our guides took us to Montaña del Oro, pointed out the spectacular geology of its cliffs, and tirelessly answered our questions about the plants, terrain, and anything else that came to mind.</P><P>One of them, Matt Ritter, turned out to be the author of a book about California plants, which I immediately bought a copy of.</P><P>The Elfin Forest: <a href='http://www.elfin-forest.org' target='_blank'>http://www.elfin-forest.org</a></P><P>Montaña del Oro: <a href='http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=592' target='_blank'>http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=592</a></P><P>California Plants: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/California-Plants-Guide-Iconic-Flora/dp/0999896008/ref' target='_blank'>https://www.amazon.com/California-Plants-Guide-Iconic-Flora/dp/0999896008/ref</a></P><P>The second through fourth days were devoted to presentations.  While I won't recap each one here -- see the link to the schedule, below -- Irwin Lightstone deserves, in my opinion, special recognition: not just for giving the first presentation, and therefore having to work his way through some issues with the AV gear, but for delivering immensely useful advice about photographing the plants we love in ways that capture their full beauty.</P><P>Sadly, one of his points regarded the double-edged sword of technology: virtually all smartphones, but also many recent cameras, use GPS to sense their exact location and embed that data into their photos.  This is ordinarily immensely useful, but it constitutes something you may want to strip out of the pictures before publishing them on-line, particularly if you're photographing something rare or endangered.</P><P>This tied into the convention's overall theme: conservation.  Most, if not all of the presentations talked in some way about species that grow in only one spot, or slowly, or both, and the threats posed to them by not just land development, but poaching.</P><P>It is, as they explained, an ongoing problem, and one we have to counter on multiple fronts: watching for and thwarting poachers; replanting poached plants when the thieves are caught in the act; learning to cultivate as many species as we can to reduce the profitability of poaching; and, finally, to ensure that our laws --- which differ from state to state and are sometimes authored with the best of intentions but incomplete understanding of the problem --- actually further the cause.</P><P>Even though the talk of poaching and the ongoing threats to rare species were in some ways daunting, the convention was, as I said, a deeply rewarding experience.  The next one will take place in Denver, in 2021, and I'm looking forward to attending it.</P><P>Schedule of Events: <a href='http://cssaconvention.com/cssa2019/2019_Schedule_of_Events.html' target='_blank'>http://cssaconvention.com/cssa2019/2019_Schedule_of_Events.html</a></P><P>One of the many things I learned at the convention was that the CSSA has a collection of videos from past conventions on-line.  They're not the easiest to find, but this link should take you to them:</P><P><a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjuG0OSS64QWqzXVR1Sxjg/videos' target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjuG0OSS64QWqzXVR1Sxjg/videos</a></P><P>On the Sunday after the convention, because I just hadn't seen enough presentations yet, I attended the meeting of our sibling organization, the Monterey Bay Area Cactus and Succulent Society.  There, the convention's master of ceremonies, Woody Minnich, gave not one, but two presentations regarding tours of South and Central America.</P><P>The Monterey Bay Area club is an extremely friendly group and has made me feel welcome every time I've visited: I encourage members who are interested to attend one of their meetings.</P><P>http://mbsucculent.org</P><P>Speaking of meetings, this coming Sunday, August the 4th, will be a split of sorts: we will have a field trip to UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens.  See elsewhere in this newsletter for the full details.</P><P>However, we also will be having a low-key meeting in the usual location, the Meeting Hall at Prusch Farms, to discuss plans for the Fall Show and Sale, which will take place September 21st and 22nd.  Those not going on the field trip but who would like to ask questions about, make suggestions for, or volunteer to help with the Show and Sale are invited to attend.</P><P>That's all for this month.  Thanks for sticking with me.  Next month's update should be shorter.  Probably.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");
