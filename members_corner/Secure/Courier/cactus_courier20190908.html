Naomi Bloss will be our speaker for the September meeting and will be leading her ever-popular and often-requested class on making succulent wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
The club will be providing 11-inch wreath forms stuffed with sphagnum moss and Naomi will be providing the succulent cuttings and expertise. The cost will be $20 per person, cash or check, payable to CSS-SJ.  Only 24 wreath forms will be available and will be distributed on a first-come first-served basis at the time of the meeting.  Making your wreath now should allow it time to get rooted by the holidays.  You are welcome to bring in cuttings of your own if you wish.
</P>

Naomi will be bringing plants for sale.

I say almost, for it was at the back of a 137 inch deep bench.  To get to the plant I had to move a lot of large plants, and, some being <I>Opuntia</I>, I was not in any hurry to go after it.  Curiosity finally got the best of me, and I spent a couple hours trying to get to the plant.  I had to move quite a few plants, until I could finally reach the plant.  I was surprised that there was still a tag that was readable. When I read <I>M. morganiana</I>, I kind of drew a blank for a few minutes.  I came in and looked up the name and discovered that there was no really good photo of a plant that I could find.  I found that I have two photos of my plant, when it was flowering and had four heads.  It was four heads not four stems, as it had just about finished splitting dichotomously.  The plant I managed to finally reach looked very much different as it was six stems, and one was splitting dichotomously.  So before too long the plant will be seven stemmed.<a href=javascript:poppic('2mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='2mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('3mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='3mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The first four photos are all of the same plant just different angles as to me it is an interesting plant. I have only the one that I can find, and I have checked for plants or seed and have not found any.  Maybe the reason is that books have messed up the identity of plants too much.  Also the web does not really help, for people have a wrongly named plant and they post a photo on the web claiming it to be plant X when it is not.  I was looking and saw plants under <I>Mammillaria morganiana</I>, but they were <I>Mammillaria hahniana</I>.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('4mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='4mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br>Apparently people have gotten into the habitat of showing photos of <I>Mammillaria hahniana</I> and posting them as <I>Mammillaria morganiana</I>.  These are not the only plants that are wrong named, and, at times, it is interesting to see the wrong names put on plants.  Many of the plants posted are bought with the wrong name on them.  Those that buy these plants keep the wrong name and will post it on the web. <I> Mammillaria hahniana</I> clumps with offsets (see a photo at the end of this article), and it looks nothing like <I>Mammillaria morganiana</I>. <I>Mammillaria morganiana</I> clumps by dividing dichotomously and looks so different from <I>M. hahniana</I>. <br><br>In the top left photo above can be seen two heads that split a long time ago, and they just look like two stems that are close together.  To the left of those two stems is a stem that has recently divided and is still just only become two heads.  In the back of the plant is a stem that is just splitting, showing that it having now two growing points.  The top right photo above shows the one stem that is now two headed, and it shows that it is only split part way down the stem.  The bottom left photo above shows a bump on the lower section of one of the stems, and I am not sure what is going on there.  It may look damaged, but it is not and I just do not know what it is up to.  It also shows how dense the spines are on the plant.  The bottom right photo above shows on the right side the stem that is just starting to divide.  The two growing points are now divided and separate but still there is no divide or space between them.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('6mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='6mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>This plant is 13 cm in diameter overall and 9 cm tall for the tallest stem. Two stems that have split, and not too long ago, are 7 cm across the two heads they are splitting into.  The one that is just starting to go dichotomous is 5 cm across, and one stem that has not split into two stems is 4.5 cm in diameter.  It is also the shortest stem.  I will not be surprised, if it starts to split into two stems this season.  The photo to the left is the growing point.  There the spines are very dense, and, down deep in the center, the central spines are already showing.  At this stage, the spines have fuzz or some wool on them, the centrals and radials.  There is also some wool on the areoles, even out on the shoulder of the plant.  At that area, the central spines have lost the wool, but the radials still have some wool on them.  The radial spines are semi translucent except at the base where they are dark pinkish.  The centrals are light pink in the middle, and then the pink becomes darker at the tip and the base. The base is not as dark as the tip of the spines.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('7mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='7mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br><br>The photo to the right is of the spines on the upper side of the plant.  There is some stringy wool on the areoles still, but, farther down the plant, it looks like it has fallen off.  The radial spines mostly grow out the areole to the left and right; more or less horizontally.  In this photo, the dark tips have faded on a lot of the central spines. They have faded to a dark pink, and the very dark tip is only a quarter the size it was at the top of the plant.  I also see no wool on the spines now, so I guess it has been washed off the plant.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('8mammillariamorganiana.jpg',1011,735)><img src='8mammillariamorganiana.jpg' width=354 height=257 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left shows the flowers quite close and shows that the center of the flower is shell pink. The filaments are a bit darker pink, the pollen is cream color, and the stigma is very light pink.  The style is about the color of the filaments.  The midstripe up the petals is pink, and, where still is concentrated, it looks brownish.  In the upper right corner can be seen a bud poking through the dense wool.  Also seen on it is the midstripe on the outer petals.  This photo was taken a few years back, when the plant was just splitting into four stems.  It is also interesting that there are only flowers and buds on the left side of the plant.  There are a lot of seed pods on the plant, and I think that mice got to all the seed pods, for I didnt get any seed.  The photo to the right below is of <I>Mammillaria hahniana</I> showing that it looks nothing like <I>Mammillaria morganiana</I>.</P><P>I give the plant my regular soil mix.  Give them good light but be careful of burning them.  They do have dense whitish spines that protect the stems, but they can burn anyway.  They come from 4600 to 5600 feet elevation [1400 to 1700 meters.] Allow to dry between waterings.  In the growing season, I give the plants a light feeding every watering.  Make sure that the water you use is acidic with a pH of 5 to 5.5.<a href=javascript:poppic('10mammillariahahniana.jpg',1011,820)><img src='10mammillariahahniana.jpg' width=354 height=287 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a></td></tr></TABLE></center>");
