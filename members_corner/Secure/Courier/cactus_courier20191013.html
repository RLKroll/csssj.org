<br>
<P>
Feeling Experimental? Well, this month we’re bringing you an entirely new program in the history of succulent-club programming!  Russell Wagner will present “Adventures in succulent Microscopy,” a live endeavor to explore the microcosm available to anyone who owns a succulent plant and a small magnifier.
</P>
<P>
Here’s the deal:  Russell will bring ten things to look at under the scope, and you, the audience, are tasked with bringing in at least one thing to show off under magnification: the subtle sheen of a plant’s skin, the tiny flowers of some rare bulb, an infestation of spider mite?  You decide!  Let’s discover together the beauties and horrors of the seeds and hairs, the petals and pustules, of our favorite plants.  You’ll never look at your plants the same again!  We may not have time to look at everything brought in, but we can get some ideas, at least, of where to begin.
</P>

Or do they?  Well, if you haven’t explored the easily accessible micro-world of succulents, lets put some plants under a digital scope and see what there is to see! </P><P>Russell plans to just talk—to share thoughts and ideas with the club about the evolution of these microscopic structures, and the weird and varied ways we all can explore and enjoy our collections up close and in person.  To re-discover our plants, to enjoy them in new ways, so even the same old collection always has something new to offer‚ takes creative play, and that’s just what we’re going to do.</P><P>Added bonus: bring in your favorite loupe, microscope, or hand lens and show us how you like to view your plants close up!</P><P><B>About the speaker<br></B>Russell Wagner, former editor of Cactus and Succulent Journal, works in the manufacture of consumer electronics in San Francisco.  Although his background is in chemistry and his job title is &quot;engineer&quot;, his passion and vocation remains succulent plants and bulbs.  His specialties, as a protégé of Steven Hammer, are rare mesembs and geophytes, and any tiny plant impresses him.  You can imagine why a microscope would strike his fancy!</P><P><B>Plants for sale<br></B>Russell is also among the Bay Area’s premier growers of rare and unusual plants.  His sale table is always filled with the most unusual and inaccessible seed-grown rarities.  This month, he will have on offer a few recent seedlings, as well as a handful of mature specimens.  Sale methods are simple:  You pick the plants.  Russell names the price.  You’re going to find $3 plants next to $100 plants, and everything in between.<br> <br>Don’t be shy: this is your opportunity to ask as many questions as you like, especially about the harder-to-grow mesembs and bulbs.

Let’s increase all exhibitor participation by at least 25% for the next show.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");

fmart ("Growers Garden","Elton Roberts","","<center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'>A couple years ago, I came in to possession of an <I>Ariocarpus retusus ssp. retusus</I> and an <I>A. retusus ssp. furfuraceus</I>.  As I remember, it was about the same time I got the two plants maybe several months apart.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('1ariocarpusretusus.jpg',1011,675)><img src='1ariocarpusretusus.jpg' width=253 height=169 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>As I usually do, I repotted the plants into my soil.  In a few months I discovered that the two plants were growing strange like.  It looked like I did something they did not like, for it looked like the plants were falling apart.  The large tubercles were not standing up like normal but were lying over and at a weird angle.  Some of the tubercles were being detached or almost so from the main stem.  I decided to leave the plants alone to see what was going on with them. The <I>A. retusus ssp. furfuraceus</I> grew into a two headed plant.  The two heads put together are at the present time smaller than the original plant.  The <I>A. retusus ssp retusus</I> went three headed but is not through doing its thing.  The three heads are now well defined, but, of the old original stem, there are still several tubercles that are half off the plant.  They are the yellow tubercles on the outside of the plant.  I have watched as the tubercles have slowly turned yellow from the plant trying to reject them, which is strange. In the photo to the left, you can see what is left of the tubercles from the plant, while it was a single headed plant.  If you look close, you can see what is left of the original tubercles, there are five left and the plant is dismissing or pushing them off the plant.  It is slowly killing the old tubercles.  I just up potted the plant a couple days ago, and several of the old tubercles were dried up and had fallen off.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('2ariocarpusretusus.jpg',1011,675)><img src='2ariocarpusretusus.jpg' width=253 height=169 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the right is a close up of the plant, and it clearly shows three heads or stems that have grown from the main stem.  The <I>furfuraceus</I> did the same thing with the old tubercles, and they all died and the plant grew into a two headed plant.  Now if you notice in the photo, the five tubercles are still attached to the plant.  As I started to up pot the plant into a larger pot, as it out grew the pot it was in, I started to remove the yellow tubercles as I figured they were mostly dead.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('3ariocarpusretusus.jpg',1011,675)><img src='3ariocarpusretusus.jpg' width=253 height=169 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The tubercle in the photo to the left is one that was part way off the plant.  About half of the tubercle was still attached to the plant.  As I moved the tubercle, I noticed roots sticking a little way out of the tubercle.  The roots were close to 1 cm long but had not made it to the soil that I could see.  If you look real close at the right hand side of the base of the tubercle, there is a growth that has some scales on it and a green curl growing out of the top of it.  I am not sure what it is, unless it is trying to grow another head or the growth is out of the base of the tubercle.  If it is out of the base of the tubercle, it could be a plantlet growing from the tubercle.  Look close at the left side of the tubercle base, and there is a little green growth which looks like it could also be a tubercle.  That is where the roots are or were showing, before I put some soil on them.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('4ariocarpusretusus.jpg',1011,675)><img src='4ariocarpusretusus.jpg' width=253 height=169 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br>In the photo to the right, which shows another tubercle, this one was half disconnected from the plant, and when I looked closely at it I saw there were roots coming out the left side of the base of the tubercle.  Note that there is a rock on the tip of the tubercle, and it is wedged down to the soil.  The reason for that is that the tubercle was standing upright at an angle of maybe 40 degrees and away from the soil.  In inspecting the tubercle, I saw that about 1.5 cm from the end of the tubercle was a thick pointed root that was trying to find the soil.  The root was about 1 cm long, and the shape of the lead in a sharpened pencil.  It had a long way to grow to reach the soil, so I pushed it down and wedged the rock on the end of the tubercle so the root would be in contact with the soil.  Now if you are skeptical about growing <I>Ariocarpus</I> plants from tubercles, you can go back, maybe as much as 20 years, in the CSSA Journal, and there are several articles on growing <I>Ariocarpus</I> from tubercles.  I wrote one of the articles, and someone else also wrote one that was published in the Journal.  His was maybe one or two Journals after my article.</P><P>I covered the rooted end with soil.  How much good it will do at this stage of the growing process, I do not know.  I also do not know if pushing the tubercle down so the root near the tip is in the soil will do any good either.  Many years ago I would work for other people that had quite a few cacti and needed help a day or two a week.  This one woman had a reputation for buying very nice plants and killing them in a few months’ time.  One time she bought an <I>Ariocarpus retusus</I> that was about 18 cm in diameter, and, sure enough within a few months, the plant was mostly rotted, but there were five or six tubercles that were still solid.  I took the tubercles home, and thought I would try planting them and see what happens.  There were tubercles that had no rot on them and there were others that were rotted about 1/4 of the way up.  I cleaned those with rot and allowed all to dry a few days, and I planted them.  I watched them carefully and gave them a watering now and then.  In time, several of them rotted away, but four of them did not rot away.  I had never tried or heard of anyone trying to root a tubercle, so I decided to check what was going on.  The one I dumped out of the pot had a good root system.  But my inspecting it insulted the roots, and that tubercle also rotted.</P><P>The rest of the tubercles stayed nice and slowly got fatter, and, in time, they made offsets or plantlets.  Some broke through from the top side of the tubercle, and some from the underside of the tubercle.  A friend that had been high in the CSSA was looking at one of the tubercles, and when he put it down did not put it down in the same orientation as it was, and before I discovered that, it had sunburned.  It took that plant quite a while to grow out of the burn.  Later on I got hold of several more tubercles from a rotting plant, and I planted them.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('7ariocarpusretusus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='7ariocarpusretusus.jpg' width=253 height=167 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left is a shot of a tubercle grown plant that has been in the world about two to three weeks.  This photo was taken in September of 2011.  Even after I wrote an article and had photos of the tubercles giving birth to plantlets, people did not believe it could happen.  With the plant in the first photo, the tubercles are still attached to the plant, and they are showing signs of wanting to grow.  I wish I had seen this sooner, but now I am hoping that the tubercles will continue to try to grow and will make plantlets in time.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");
