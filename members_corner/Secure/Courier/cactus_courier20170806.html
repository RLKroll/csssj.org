<B class="leadhead">Wendy Soneson - Watercolor of Succulents</B><br>
<br>
<P>
Cacti and succulents come in such a wide variety of shapes and colors and have such amazing flowers, that I’m sure many of you have taken photographs of your plants.  But have you ever considered stepping it up a level and painting pictures of them instead?  Would you like to know how to get started?
</P>
<P>
Wendy Soneson has been teaching watercolor for 40 years in Boston and recently moved to the Bay Area.  She teaches classes at several locations including the Ruth Bancroft Garden in Walnut Creek, where the focus is succulents and cacti.  She had demonstrated the art in major museums and has shown her work in several places in the Bay Area.  The luminosity of watercolor is masterful in depicting nature, and Wendy hopes many will be inspired to try this delicate medium in the future.  She has a Masters degree in the Arts in Human Development from Lesley University.

fmart ("Spotlight Interview with Lloyd Binen","Asmita Deshpande","","Lloyd’s Cacti and Succulents collection started some 25 years ago when his wife, Joyce, started buying inexpensive succulents from grocery stores and placing them around the house.  He got interested in them, when she started pointing out details he had not noticed, their textures, shapes and patterns.  He now has a sizable collection of cacti and succulents.  His favorites cactus is <I>Alluaudia Procera</I>, and, among the succulents, he likes <I>Agave Parryi Truncata</I>, <I>Agave Attenuata</I>, <I>Aloe Striata</I>, and <I>Agave Victoriae-reginae</I>.</P><P>He joined our Cactus and Succulent Society just over a year and half ago, but he has been a regular attendant of the society’s sales for a very long time.  He has bought a lot of plants over the years through the sales.</P><P>Lloyd and his wife live in Saratoga and have a grown son who lives in Venice Beach, SoCal.  He has been a realtor since 1976.  His wife, Joyce, was a pottery teacher at community colleges and has made lovely pottery, some of which he has used for his garden.</P><P>Besides Cacti and Succulents, he also likes tending his Koi and walking his Jack Russell Terrier mix, Chase.  He still occasionally works as a realtor, but the majority of his time is spent taking care of his wife who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease eight years ago.  Whenever he gets a little time for himself, he likes to spend it in his gardens with his plants.  &quot;Fiddle-farting&quot; he calls it.</P><P>His message for the club is to keep up the good work and to have the growers more readily available to give information and answer questions about the plants they’re selling.");

On the stem in the back is a small cluster of buds, but the strange thing is on the stem in the fore ground.  Looking, you can see normal growing single buds and no clusters showing up.  But look again.  Notice that there are two buds growing from areoles.  There is also one dead flower remains that also bloomed from an areole.  In all my 60+ years of growing cactus plants, I do not remember seeing Mammillaria plants blooming from an areole.  I am not an expert on Mammillaria, but I do not think that they are supposed to bloom from an areole; it has always been from the axil.  The photo to the right shows a bud growing from an areole.  There is no question about it that is growing from an areole!  The photo below also shows different buds that have grown from areoles.  I counted on this plant about ten buds that have grown from the areoles.  I have two multiheaded plants, and the other plant growing within 30 cm is a bit smaller than the one in the first photo above, and it is growing normally with buds only from the axil.  That is, no clusters of buds from the axils and no buds from the areoles.  In the photo below, there are three buds growing from areoles.  To me it looks like they are almost growing from under the spine cluster.  Each is a different size; the one at the bottom right is just showing above the areole.  At the base of the bud is wool from the areole; it is against the bud, showing that it is growing from the areole.  For anyone that knows Mammillaria, they know that flowers from an areole is not something that a Mammillaria does.  I sent the photos to a friend that had grown Mammillarias for most of his cactus growing life, and he said he had never seen anything like that before.  I figured if anyone would know he would, for he studies his plants very carefully and knows all of them like the back of his hand.<br><center><a href=javascript:poppic('8mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg',1011,674)><img src='8mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg' width=404 height=270 hspace=17 vspace=17 class='enl'></a></center></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('11mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg',1011,674)><img src='11mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg' width=303 height=202 hspace=27 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><a href=javascript:poppic('12mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg',1011,674)><img src='12mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg' width=303 height=202 hspace=27 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a>I went on the Web and all the photos I found of the plant, there was not a single one that had buds or flowers growing out of the areole.  I do not think my plant is monstrose but it sure is doing something that is, for me, strange.  Clusters of buds in the place of one and buds from the areoles on Mammillaria plants are just something I had never seen before.  I have not seen anything written about any Mammillaria that grows flowers from the areole.  These photos are of the plants with several clusters of flowers open.  Not all the buds in a cluster open at one time.  If they did, that would really make the clusters dense.  The photo to the left is a round cluster, and the photo to the right is of a long cluster.  Keep in mind that all the flowers in a cluster are from one axil.  Each of the clusters has eight flowers open from the one axil.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('13mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg',1007,853)><img src='13mammillariaschumanniivglobosa.jpg' width=403 height=341 hspace=27 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left shows a flower that is open and has grown out of the areole and not the axil.  Notice that the flower has even pushed several spines out of its way.

I thought it would be of some interest to the people that are really into growing Mammillaria and know the right way the plants are supposed to grow and flower.  The friend mentioned above sent me a map showing that the habitat of <I>Mammillaria schumannii v globosa</I> is now all built up with houses, and the habitat has apparently been destroyed.  With Anderson and the NCL totally ignoring the plant, it will slowly fade off into the sunset.  At the present time, there are a few people that are trying to keep it going.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");

You will need a few tools like a pair of rubberized dish washing gloves, a sharp cutting tool (or tools) such as a sharp pair of pruning sheers or a heavy butcher's knife. You will also need a bucket of tap water to coagulate the milky sap and a pair of glasses or goggle would be handy. Sneak up on your selected <I>Euphoria</I> and behead it. Plunge the cutting into the bucket of water for a minute or two. Place your cutting into a container of #2 horticultural perlite. Water it well and place it in your warmest spot out of the sun. Water twice a week until roots form, then transplant into your usual potting mix. The most difficult job is keeping the <I>Euphorbia</I> juice out of your eyes and off your skin. Some <I>Euphorbias</I> will blister your skin and all will make your eyes water, if you get the juice into them.  Gil Tegelberg recommended the juice of <I>Aeonium lindlyi</I>; he could squeeze 36 drops from a single leaf.  I have never had much luck with his cure.");
