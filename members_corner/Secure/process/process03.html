SHOW & SALE NOTICE PUBLICATION:  The dates, time, and location of the Club’s Show &amp; Sale is published in the Cactus Courier newsletter, and also on the club’s website, <a href="http://www.csssj.org">http://www.csssj.org</a>.  Including a good map helps first-timers find the place.
</P>
<P>
LOCATION:  Buchser Middle School’s Cafetorium, 1111 Bellomy St,  Santa Clara, CA 95050
</P>
<P>
HOW TO RESERVE THE ROOM: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Cafetorium (multi-purpose room) is reserved in January for that year’s Show &amp; Sales via the Buchser School Principal’s secretary, Annette Vizcarro, phone #423-3010, 1111 Bellomy St Santa Clara CA 95050, <a href="mailto:avizcarr@scu.k12.ca.us">avizcarr@scu.k12.ca.us</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another key contact is the Head Custodian, who controls access to the room, and any issues with functionality of the facility, such as lighting or bathrooms.   Since this person’s identity changes from time to time, get his name and phone number from the school secretary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The club pays 10% of the club’s NET proceeds (that is, after expenses) as rental for the facility, and occasionally provides an additional donation as well.  These monies are to be specifically designated on the check as being for the use of the school’s Science programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, the club pays $320 total for the custodian labor during the time we have reserved the room.  The custodians are active to unlock and lock the facility,as well as for general cleanup.  The club receives the bill from the school after the show, sometimes 2 or 3 months after.  The labor amount is based on a total of 8 hrs labor over the 2 ½ days, at a rate of $40/hr.
</P>
<P>
HOW TO RESERVE THE TABLES:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About 3 tables are the school’s and are brought in, if not already there, by the school’s custodians.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We rent most tables (8 ft x 30 in) from Williams Party Rental, 845 Park Ave, SJ, phone # 408-297-1078, www.willparty.com, at  $8 per table with a $200 security deposit.  There is a $50 fee for delivery and another $50 fee for pickup.  Occasionally there is another minimal fee, such as a fuel surcharge.  These items should be reserved about 4 weeks before each Show &amp; Sale.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Williams Party Rental delivers the tables to a stack just inside the door. Williams is not available to do table setup for us.  Club members/vendors set up the tables in both the sales area and the show area, per the table layout on the next page.  We also put paper and skirting on the tables in the show area.  A club member should be identified to provide several rolls of paper and several rolls of plastic skirting, along with several pairs of scissors and several rolls of masking tapte.
</P>
<P>
ACCESS & HOUSEKEEPING:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The school custodians lock and unlock the Cafetorium room.  We do NOT have keys.  The room is unlocked at 7AM on Saturday and 8AM on Sunday.  The room is locked at about 6PM on Saturday and about 5:30PM on Sunday.  We do not have to stick around until they close up.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We sweep up, but do not mop.  We should also dust mop the floors occasionally during the show to clear out any spilled dirt/gravel/leaves.
